Please respond thoroughly (at least two sentences for each question) to
the following three questions.

1. Describe an experience you had this semester where you saw the power of
functions.
I really saw the power of functions when it came to breaking down code 
into more manageable pieces. I saw it from my first week to my last week.


2. In your judgment, what is the value of test functions?

The value of any test function is to specifically test whether or not
a function is able to run properly or does run properly.

3. Describe your process for troubleshooting and fixing a program that
has a problem. What is one thing you can do to improve your process?

    I generally like to go onto the web and try to find syntax for what
    I am looking for, I also like to ask people for help when possible and 
    also try to break down each part of the code into chunks.
